massive hack:
* download from kepler as a html
* edit html to change one link which is failing (based on this [comment|https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/issues/2202])
  
    I exported as html from Kepler and the only thing I changed was the link it had by this one: "https://unpkg.com/kepler.gl@2.4.0/umd/keplergl.min.js"

* upload to my own Github Pages account to host the html
